                     draft-pauly-encrypted-resolver

Abstract

   This document defines a DNS resource record, DOHNS, that identifies a
   designated name server that provides DNS Over HTTPS (DoH) access to
   clients and recursive resolvers.  The record also contains associated
   data required to use the name server.

1.  Introduction

   DNS-over-HTTPS [RFC8484] (DoH) provides an encrypted and multiplexed
   mechanism for performing DNS queries.  DoH provides a mechanism for
   encryption, which can help provide some privacy and security
   benefits.

   Communication between recursive resolvers and authoritative servers
   is not generally peformed over encrypted channels, however, since the
   location of authoritative servers in NS resource records (RRs) does
   not indicate that these servers provide support of protocols like
   DoH.

   Discovering DNS servers that provide access over DoH can also be used
   directly by clients.  These servers can be specifically designated as
   the correct resolvers to use for a given zone.  Adaptive DNS ([ADNS])
   defines an algorithm that clients can use to improve their privacy
   stance by using multiple DoH servers for resolution, and only
   resolving with a server directly when that server is specifically
   designated for the zone that is being resolved.

   This document defines a new RR, DOHNS, to indicate the location of an
   designated DNS server that is accessible over DoH, along with
   information necessary for clients to use the server.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The DOHNS Resource Record

   The DOHNS RR contains two pieces of information in its RDATA:

   o  The URI Template of the DoH server [RFC8484]

   o  The optional public key of the DoH server used for proxied
      obfuscated queries [OBFUSCATION]

   The RDATA is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   |      URI Template Length      |       Public Key Length       |
   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   ~                URI Template (Variable Length)                 ~
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   ~                  Public Key (Variable Length)                 ~
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   URI Template Length:  A 16-bit unsigned integer, in network byte
      order, that indicates the length of the URI Template field.

   Public Key Length:  A 16-bit unsigned integer, in network byte order,
      that indicates the length of the Public Key field.

   URI Template:  The URI Template for the Designated DoH Server, as
      defined in [RFC8484].  This is a string encoded as UTF-8
      characters.

   Public Key:  A public key used for Obfuscated DoH, as defined in
      [OBFUSCATION].

3.  Security Considerations

   All DOHNS resource records MUST be signed with DNSSEC, by being part
   of a RRset that is covered by an RRSIG RR [RFC4034].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new RRTYPE in accordance with [RFC6895].
   Please add the the following entry to the data type range of the
   Resource Record (RR) TYPEs registry:
