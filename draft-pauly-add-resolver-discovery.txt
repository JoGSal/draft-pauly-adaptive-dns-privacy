Abstract

   This document defines a method for dynamically discovering resolvers
   that support encrypted transports, and introduces the concept of a
   designating a resolver to be used for a subset of client queries
   based on domain.  This method is intended to work both for locally-
   hosted resolvers and resolvers accessible over the broader Internet.

1.  Introduction

   When clients need to resolve names into addresses in order to
   establish networking connections, they traditionally use by default
   the DNS resolver that is provisioned by the local network along with
   their IP address [RFC2132] [RFC8106].  Alternatively, they can use a
   resolver indicated by a tunneling service such as a VPN.

   However, privacy-sensitive clients might prefer to use an encrypted
   DNS service other than the one locally provisioned in order to
   prevent interception, profiling, or modification by entities other
   than the operator of the name service for the name being resolved.

   Protocols that can improve the transport security of a client when
   using DNS or creating TLS connections include DNS-over-TLS [RFC7858],
   DNS-over-HTTPS [RFC8484], and encrypted Server Name Indication (ESNI)
   [I-D.ietf-tls-esni].

   This document defines a method for dynamically discovering resolvers
   that support encrypted transports, and introduces the concept of a
   designating a resolver to be used for a subset of client queries
   based on domain.  This method is intended to work both for locally-
   hosted resolvers and resolvers accessible over the broader Internet.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Designated Resolver:  A DNS resolver that is designated as a
      responsible resolver for a given domain or zone.

   Direct Resolver:  A DNS resolver using any transport that is
      provisioned directly by a local router or a VPN.

3.  Designated Resolvers

   *  Based on DNSSEC-signed SVCB record

   *  Based on confirmation of a trusted domain, listed in additional
      information

   *  Use IP hints for addresses

4.  Discovering Designated DoH Resolvers

   Clients dynamically build and maintain a set of known Designated DoH
   Servers.  The information that is associated with each server is:

   *  The URI Template of the DoH server [RFC8484]

   *  A list of domains for which the DoH server is designated





Pauly, et al.            Expires 6 November 2020                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                     May 2020


   This information can be retrieved from several different sources.
   The primary source for discovering Designated DoH Server
   configurations is from properties stored in a SVCB (or a SVCB-
   conformant type like HTTPSSVC) DNS Record
   [I-D.nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc].  This record provides the URI
   Template of a DoH server that is designated for a specific domain.  A
   specific domain may have more than one such record.

   In order to designate a DoH server for a domain, a SVCB record can
   contain the "dohuri" (Section 11).  The value stored in the parameter
   is a URI, which is the DoH URI template [RFC8484].

   The following example shows a record containing a DoH URI, as
   returned by a query for the HTTPSSVC variant of the SVCB record type
   on "example.com".

      example.com.      7200  IN HTTPSSVC 0 svc.example.net.
      svc.example.net.  7200  IN HTTPSSVC 2 svc1.example.net. (
                                                                              dohuri=https://doh.example.net/dns-query
                                                                              odohkey="..." )

   Clients SHOULD NOT accept designations for effective top-level
   domains (eTLDs), such as ".com".

5.  Explicit Discovery of Local Resolvers

   If the local network provides configuration with an Explicit
   Provisioning Domain (PvD), as defined by
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains], clients can learn about
   domains for which the local network's resolver is authoritative.

   If an RA provided by the router on the network defines an Explicit
   PvD that has additional information, and this additional information
   JSON dictionary contains the key "dohTemplate" (Section 11), then the
   client SHOULD add this DoH server to its list of known DoH
   configurations.  The domains that the DoH server claims authority for
   are listed in the "dnsZones" key.  Clients MUST use an SVCB record
   from the locally-provisioned DoH server and validate the answer with
   DNSSEC [RFC4033] before creating a mapping from the domain to the
   server.  Once this has been validated, clients can use this server
   for resolution as described in step 2.

   See Section 8 for local deployment considerations.

6.  Discovery of DoH Capabilities for Direct Resolvers

7.  Server Deployment Considerations

   When servers designate DoH servers for their names, the specific
   deployment model can impact the effective privacy and performance
   characteristics.

7.1.  Single Content Provider

   If a name always resolves to server IP addresses that are hosted by a
   single content provider, the name ought to designate a single DoH
   server.  This DoH server will be most optimal when it is designated
   by many or all names that are hosted by the same content provider.
   This ensures that clients can increase connection reuse to reduce
   latency in connection setup.

   A DoH server that corresponds to the content provider that hosts
   content has an opportunity to tune the responses provided to a client
   based on the location inferred by the client IP address.

7.2.  Multiple Content Providers

   Some hostnames may resolve to server IP addresses that are hosted by
   multiple content providers.  In such scenarios, the deployment may
   want to be able to control the percentage of traffic that flows to
   each content provider.

   In these scenarios, there can either be:

   *  multiple designated DoH servers that are advertised via SVCB DNS
      Records; or,

   *  a single designated DoH server that can be referenced by one or
      more SVCB DNS Records, operated by a party that is aware of both
      content providers and can manage splitting the traffic.

   If a server deployment wants to easily control the split of traffic
   between different content providers, it ought to use the latter model
   of using a single designated DoH server that can better control which
   IP addresses are provided to clients.  Otherwise, if a client is
   aware of multiple DoH servers, it might use a single resolver
   exclusively, which may lead to inconsistent behavior between clients
   that choose different resolvers.

7.3.  Avoid Narrow Deployments

   Using designated DoH servers can improve the privacy of name
   resolution whenever a DoH server is designated by many different
   names within one or more domains.  This limits the amount of
   information leaked to an attacker observing traffic between a client
   and a DoH server: the attacker only learns that the client might be
   resolving one of the many names for which the server is designated.

   However, if a deployment designates a given DoH server for only one
   name, or a very small set of names, then it becomes easier for an
   attacker to infer that a specific name is being accessed by a client.
   For this reason, deployments are encouraged to avoid deploying a DoH
   server that is only designated by a small number of names.  Clients
   can also choose to only whitelist DoH servers that are associated
   with many names.

   Beyond the benefits to privacy, having a larger number of names
   designate a given DoH server improves the opportunity for DoH
   connection reuse, which can improve the performance of name
   resolutions.

8.  Local Resolver Deployment Considerations

   A key goal of Adaptive DNS is that clients will be able to use
   Designated DoH Servers to improve the privacy of queries, without
   entirely bypassing local network authority and policy.  For example,
   if a client is attached to an enterprise Wi-Fi network that provides
   access and resolution for private names not generally accessible on
   the Internet, such names will only be usable when a local resolver is
   used.

   In order to achieve this, a local network can advertise itself as
   authoritative for a domain, allowing it to be used prior to external
   servers in the client resolution algorithm.

8.1.  Designating Local DoH Servers

   If a local network wants to have clients send queries for a set of
   private domains to its own resolver, it needs to define an explicit
   provisioning domain [I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains].  The PvD
   RA option SHOULD set the H-flag to indicate that Additional
   Information is available.  This Additional Information JSON object
   SHOULD include both the "dohTemplate" and "dnsZones" keys to define
   the local DoH server and the domains over which it claims authority.

   In order to validate that a local resolver is designated for a given
   zone, the client SHOULD issue a SVCB record query for the names



Pauly, et al.            Expires 6 November 2020                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                     May 2020


   specified in the PvD information, using the DoH server specified in
   the PvD information.  If there is no SVCB record for a name that
   points to the DoH server that can be validated using DNSSEC, the
   client SHOULD NOT automatically create a designation from the domain
   name to DoH server.  See specific use cases in Section 8.2 for cases
   in which a local resolver may still be used.

8.2.  Local Use Cases

   The various use cases for selecting locally-provisioned resolvers
   require different approaches for deployment and client resolution.
   The following list is not exhaustive, but provides guidance on how
   these scenarios can be achieved using the Adaptive DNS algorithm.

8.2.1.  Accessing Local-Only Resolvable Content

   Some names are not resolvable using generic DNS resolvers, but
   require using a DNS server that can resolve private names.  This is
   common in enterprise scenarios, in which an enterprise can have a set
   of private names that it allows to be resolved when connected to a
   VPN or an enterprise-managed Wi-Fi network.  In this case, clients
   that do not use the locally-provisioned resolver will fail to resolve
   private names.

   In these scenarios, the local network SHOULD designate a local DoH
   server for the domains that are locally resolvable.  For example, an
   enterprise that owns "private.example.org" would advertise
   "private.example.org" in its PvD information along with a DoH URI
   template.  Clients could then use that locally-configured resolver
   with names under "private.example.org" according to the rules in
   Section 8.1.

   In general, clients SHOULD only create designated DoH server
   associations when they can validate a SVCB record using DNSSEC.
   However, some deployments of private names might not want to sign all
   private names within a zone.  There are thus a few possible
   deployment models:

   *  "private.example.org" does have a DNSSEC-signed SVCB record that
      points to the local DoH server.  The client requests the SVCB
      record for "private.example.org" using the local DoH server that
      is specified in the PvD information, and from that point on uses
      the local DoH server for names under "private.example.org".

   *  Instead of signing "private.example.org", the deployment provides
      a DNSSEC-signed SVCB record for "example.org", thus steering all
      resolution under "example.org" to the local resolver.




Pauly, et al.            Expires 6 November 2020                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                     May 2020


   *  No DNSSEC-signed SVCB record designates the local server.  In this
      case, clients have a hint that the local network can serve names
      under "private.example.org", but do not have a way to validate the
      designation.  Clients can in this case try to resolve names using
      external servers (such as via Oblivious DoH), and then MAY fall
      back to using locally-provisioned resolvers if the names do not
      resolve externally.  This approach has the risk of exposing
      private names to public resolvers, which can be undesirable for
      certain enterprise deployments.  Alternatively, if the client
      trusts the local network based on specific policy configured on
      the client, it can choose to resolve these names locally first.
      Note that this approach risks exposing names to a potentially
      malicious network that is masquerading as an authority for private
      names if the network cannot be validated in some other manner.

   Deployments SHOULD use the one of the first two approaches (signing
   their records) whenever possible; the case of providing unsigned
   names is only described as a possibility for handling legacy
   enterprise deployments.  Clients SHOULD choose to ignore any locally
   designated names that are not signed unless there is a specific
   policy configuration on the client.

8.2.2.  Accessing Locally Optimized Content

   Other names may be resolvable both publicly and on the local
   resolver, but have more optimized servers that are accessible only
   via the local network.  For example, a Wi-Fi provider may provide
   access to a cache of video content that provides lower latency than
   publicly-accessible caches.

   Names that are hosted locally in this way SHOULD use a designation
   with a DNSSEC-signed SVCB record for the name.  If a client discovers
   that a local resolver is designated for a given name, the client
   SHOULD prefer using connections to this locally-hosted content rather
   than names resolved externally.

   Note that having a DNSSEC-signed designation to the local resolver
   provides a clear indication that the entity that manages a given name
   has an explicit relationship with the local network provider.

8.2.3.  Walled-Garden and Captive Network Deployments

   Some networks do not provide any access to the general Internet, but
   host local content that clients can access.  For example, a network
   on an airplane can give access to flight information and in-flight
   media, but will not allow access to any external hosts or DNS
   servers.  These networks are often described as "walled-gardens".




Pauly, et al.            Expires 6 November 2020                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                     May 2020


   Captive networks [I-D.ietf-capport-architecture] are similar in that
   they block access to external hosts, although they can provide
   generic access after some time.

   If a walled-garden or captive network defines a PvD with additional
   information, it can define zones for names that it hosts, such as
   "airplane.example.com".  It can also provide a locally-hosted
   encrypted DNS server.

   However, if such a network does not support explicitly advertising
   local names, clients that try to establish connections to DoH servers
   will experience connection failures.  In these cases, system traffic
   that is used for connecting to captive portals SHOULD use local
   resolvers.  In addition, clients MAY choose to fall back to using
   direct resolution without any encryption if they determine that all
   connectivity is blocked otherwise.  Note that this comes with a risk
   of a network blocking connections in order to induce this fallback
   behavior, so clients might want to inform users about this possible
   attack where appropriate, or prefer to not fall back if there is a
   concern about leaking user data.

8.2.4.  Network-Based Filtering

   Some networks currently rely on manipulating DNS name resolution in
   order to apply content filtering rules to clients associated with the
   network.  Using encrypted DNS resolvers that are not participating in
   this filtering can bypass such enforcement.  However, simply blocking
   connections for filtering is indistinguishable from a malicious
   attack from a client's perspective.

   In order to indicate the presence of filtering requirements, a
   network deployment can add the "requireDNSFiltering" and
   "dnsFilteredZones" keys to its PvD information.  The
   "dnsFilteredZones" entry can contain an array of strings, each of
   which is a domain name that the network requires clients to resolve
   using the local resolver.  If the array contains the string ".", it
   indicates the network requires filtering for all domains.  If
   "requireDNSFiltering" is present with a boolean value of true, the
   network is indicating that it expects all client systems to send the
   names indicated by "dnsFilteredZones" to the local resolver.  If
   "requireDNSFiltering" is not present or set to false, then the
   filtering service is considered to be optional for clients that want
   to use it as a service to enforce desired policy.

   Clients that receive indication of filtering requirements SHOULD NOT
   use any other resolver for the filtered domains, but treat the
   network as claiming authority.  However, since this filtering cannot

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                     May 2020


   be authenticated, this behavior SHOULD NOT be done silently without
   user consent.

   Networks that try to interfere with connections to encrypted DNS
   resolvers without indicating a requirement for filtering cannot be
   distinguished from misconfigurations or network attacks.  Clients MAY
   choose to avoid sending any user-initiated connections on such
   networks to prevent malicious interception.

9.  Security Considerations

   In order to avoid interception and modification of the information
   retrieved by clients using Adaptive DNS, all exchanges between
   clients and servers are performed over encrypted connections, e.g.,
   TLS.

   Malicious adversaries may block client connections to a DoH service
   as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) measure.  Clients which cannot connect
   to any proxy may, by local policy, fall back to unencrypted DNS if
   this occurs.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   Clients must be careful in determining to which DoH servers they send
   queries directly without proxying.  A malicious DoH server that can
   direct queries to itself can track or profile client activity.  In
   order to avoid the possibility of a spoofed SVCB record designating a
   malicious DoH server for a name, clients MUST ensure that such
   records validate using DNSSEC [RFC4033].

   Even servers that are officially designated can risk leaking or
   logging information about client lookups.  Such risk can be mitigated
   by further restricting the list of DoH servers that are whitelisted
   for direct use based on client policy.

   An adversary able to see traffic on each path segment of a DoH query
   (e.g., from client to proxy, proxy to target, and target to an
   authoritative DNS server) can link queries to specific clients with
   high probability.  Failure to observe traffic on any one of these
   path segments makes this linkability increasingly difficult.  For
   example, if an adversary can only observe traffic between a client
   and proxy and egress traffic from a target, then it may be difficult
   identify a specific client's query among the recursive queries
   generated by the target.

   | requireDNSFiltering | A flag to indicate     | Boolean | true    |
   |                     | that the network       |         |         |
   |                     | requires filtering all |         |         |
   |                     | DNS traffic using the  |         |         |

   |                     | provisioned resolver.  |         |         |
   +---------------------+------------------------+---------+---------+

                                 Table 2

   Any network that sets the "requireDNSFiltering" boolean to false but
   provides "dnsFilteredZones" advertises the optional service of
   filtering on the provisioned network.

   An "." in the "dnsFilteredZones" array represents a wildcard, which
   can be used to indicate that the network is requesting to filter all
   names.  Any more specific string represents a domain that requires
   filtering on the network.
