<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">When clients need to resolve names into addresses in order to establish networking connections, they traditionally use by default the DNS resolver that is provisioned by the local network along with their IP address <a href="#RFC2132" class="xref">[RFC2132]</a> <a href="#RFC8106" class="xref">[RFC8106]</a>. Alternatively, they can use a resolver indicated by a tunneling service such as a VPN.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">However, privacy-sensitive clients might prefer to use an encrypted DNS service other than the one locally provisioned in order to prevent interception, profiling, or modification by entities other than the operator of the name service for the name being resolved. Protocols that can improve the transport security of a client when using DNS or creating TLS connections include DNS-over-TLS <a href="#RFC7858" class="xref">[RFC7858]</a>, DNS-over-HTTPS <a href="#RFC8484" class="xref">[RFC8484]</a>, and encrypted Server Name Indication (ESNI) <a href="#I-D.ietf-tls-esni" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-tls-esni]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">There are several concerns around a client using such privacy-enhancing mechanisms for generic system traffic. A remote service that provides encrypted DNS may not provide correct answers for locally available resources, or private resources (such as domains only accessible over a private network). Remote services may also be untrusted from a privacy perspective: while encryption will prevent on-path observers from seeing hostnames, client systems need to trust the encrypted DNS service to not store or misuse queries made to it. Further, extensive use of cloud based recursive resolvers obscures the network location of the client which may degrade the performance of the returned server due to lack of proximity at the benefit of improved privacy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Client systems are left with choosing between one of the following stances:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Send all application DNS queries to a particular encrypted DNS service, which requires establishing user trust of the service. This can lead to resolution failures for local or private enterprise domains absent heuristics or other workarounds for detecting managed networks.</li>
<li>Allow the user or another entity to configure local policy for which domains to send to local, private, or encrypted resolvers. This provides more granularity at the cost of increasing user burden.</li>
<li>Only use locally-provisioned resolvers, and opportunistically use encrypted DNS to these resolvers when possible. (Clients may learn of encrypted transport support by actively probing such resolvers.) This provides marginal benefit over not using encrypted DNS at all, especially if clients have no means of authenticating or trusting local resolvers.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">This document defines an architecture that allows clients to improve the privacy of their DNS queries without requiring user intervention, and allowing coexistence with local, private, and enterprise resolvers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">This architecture is composed of several mechanisms:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>A DNS record that indicates a designated DoH server associated with a name (<a href="#designated-discovery" class="xref">Section 3.1</a>);</li>
<li>an extension to DoH that allows client IP addresses to be disassociated from queries via proxying (<a href="#OBLIVIOUS" class="xref">[OBLIVIOUS]</a>);</li>
<li>a DoH server that responds to queries directly and supports proxying (<a href="#server" class="xref">Section 4</a>);</li>
<li>and client behavior rules for how to resolve names using a combination of designated DoH resolvers, proxied queries, and local resolvers (<a href="#client" class="xref">Section 3</a>).</li>

<dl>
<dt>Adaptive DNS:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Adaptive DNS is a technique to provide an encrypted transport for DNS queries that can be sent directly to a Designated DoH Server, to use Oblivious DoH to hide the client IP address, or to use Direct Resolvers when required or appropriate.</dd>
<dt>Designated DoH Server:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A DNS resolver that provides connectivity over HTTPS (DoH) that is designated as a responsible resolver for a given domain or zone.</dd>
<dt>Direct Resolver:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A DNS resolver using any transport that is provisioned directly by a local router or a VPN.</dd>
<dt>Exclusive Direct Resolver:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A Direct Resolver that requires the client to use it exclusively for a given set of domains, such as private domains managed by a VPN. This status is governed by local system policy.</dd>
<dt>Oblivious DoH:</dt>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">Adaptive DNS allows client systems and applications to improve the privacy of their DNS queries and connections, both by requiring confidentiality via encryption, and by limiting the ability to correlate client IP addresses with query contents.  Specifically, the goal for client queries is to achieve the following properties:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>No party other than the client and server can learn or control the names being queried by the client or the answers being returned by the server.</li>
<li>Only a designated DNS resolver associated with the deployment that is also hosting content will be able to read both the client IP address and queried names for Privacy-Sensitive Connections. For example, a resolver owned and operated by the same provider that hosts &#8220;example.com&#8221; would be able to link queries for &#8220;example.com&#8221; to specific clients (by their IP address), since the server ultimately has this capability once clients subsequently establish secure (e.g., TLS) connections to an address to which &#8220;example.com&#8221; resolves.</li>
<li>Clients will be able to comply with policies required by VPNs and local networks that are authoritative for private domains.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">An algorithm for determining how to resolve a given name in a manner that satisfies these properties is described in <a href="#resolution-algorithm" class="xref">Section 3.3</a>. Note that this algorithm does not guarantee that responses that are not signed with DNSSEC are valid, and clients that establish connections to unsigned addresses may still expose their local IP addresses to attackers that control their terminal resolver even if hidden during resolution.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.5">Clients MAY further choose to restrict the whitelist by other local policy. For example, a client system can have a list of trusted resolver configurations, and it can limit the whitelist of Designated DoH Servers to configurations that match this list.

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">When establishing a secure connection to a certain hostname, clients need to first determine which resolver configuration ought to be used for DNS resolution.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">Several of the steps outlined in this algorithm take into account the success or failure of name resolution. Failure can be indicated either by a DNS response, such as SERVFAIL or NXDOMAIN, or by a connection-level failure, such as a TCP reset, TLS handshake failure, or an HTTP response error status. In effect, any unsuccessful attempt to resolve a name can cause the client to try another resolver if permitted by the algorithm. This is particularly useful for cases in which a name may not be resolvable over public DNS but has a valid answer only on the local network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">Given a specific hostname, the order of preference for which resolver to use SHOULD be:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>An Exclusive Direct Resolver, such as a resolver provisioned by a VPN, with domain rules that include the hostname being resolved. If the resolution fails, the connection will fail. See <a href="#local-discovery" class="xref">Section 3.2</a> and <a href="#local-deployment" class="xref">Section 6</a>.</li>
<li>A Direct Resolver, such as a local router, with domain rules that are known to be authoritative for the domain containing the hostname. If the resolution fails, the connection will try the next resolver configuration based on this list.</li>
<li>The most specific Designated DoH Server that has been whitelisted (<a href="#whitelisting" class="xref">Section 3.1.1</a>) for the domain containing the hostname, i.e., the designated DoH server which is associated with the longest matching prefix of the hostname. For example, given two Designated DoH Servers, one for foo.example.com and another example.com, clients connecting to bar.foo.example.com should use the former. If the resolution fails, the connection will try an Oblivious DoH query.</li>
<li>Oblivious DoH queries using multiple DoH Servers (<a href="#oblivious" class="xref">Section 3.4</a>). If this resolution fails, Privacy-Sensitive Connections will fail. All other connections will use the last resort, the default Direct Resolvers.</li>
<li>The default Direct Resolver, generally the resolver provisioned by the local router, is used as the last resort for any connection that is not explicitly Privacy-Sensitive <a href="#RFC2132" class="xref">[RFC2132]</a> <a href="#RFC8106" class="xref">[RFC8106]</a>.</li>

Some combinations will be able to handle more load than others, and some will have better latency properties than others. To optimize performance, clients SHOULD maintain statistics to track the performance characteristics and success rates of particular pairs.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">Using designated DoH servers can improve the privacy of name resolution whenever a DoH server is designated by many different names within one or more domains.  This limits the amount of information leaked to an attacker observing traffic between a client and a DoH server: the attacker only learns that the client might be resolving one of the many names for which the server is designated (or might be performing an Oblivious query).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">However, if a deployment designates a given DoH server for only one name, or a very small set of names, then it becomes easier for an attacker to infer that a specific name is being accessed by a client. For this reason, deployments are encouraged to avoid deploying a DoH server that is only designated by a small number of names.  Clients can also choose to only whitelist DoH servers that are associated with many names.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.3">Beyond the benefits to privacy, having a larger number of names designate a given DoH server improves the opportunity for DoH connection reuse, which can improve the performance of name resolutions.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">A key goal of Adaptive DNS is that clients will be able to use Designated DoH Servers to improve the privacy of queries, without entirely bypassing local network authority and policy. For example, if a client is attached to an enterprise Wi-Fi network that provides access and resolution for private names not generally accessible on the Internet, such names will only be usable when a local resolver is used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">In order to achieve this, a local network can advertise itself as authoritative for a domain, allowing it to be used prior to external servers in the client resolution algorithm <a href="#resolution-algorithm" class="xref">Section 3.3</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.1">6.1.</a> <a href="#designating-local-servers" id="designating-local-servers">Designating Local DoH Servers</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">If a local network wants to have clients send queries for a set of private domains to its own resolver, it needs to define an explicit provisioning domain <a href="#I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains]</a>.  The PvD RA option SHOULD set the H-flag to indicate that Additional Information is available.  This Additional Information JSON object SHOULD include both the &#8220;dohTemplate&#8221; and &#8220;dnsZones&#8221; keys to define the local DoH server and the domains over which it claims authority.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">In order to validate that a local resolver is designated for a given zone, the client SHOULD issue a SVCB record query for the names specified in the PvD information, using the DoH server specified in the PvD information. If there is no SVCB record for a name that points to the DoH server that can be validated using DNSSEC, the client SHOULD NOT automatically create a designation from the domain name to DoH server.  See specific use cases in <a href="#local-use-cases" class="xref">Section 6.2</a> for cases in which a local resolver may still be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.3">Although local Designated DoH Servers MAY support proxying Oblivious DoH queries, a client SHOULD NOT select one of these servers as an Oblivious Proxy. Doing so might reveal the client&#8217;s location to the Target based on the address of the proxy, which could contribute to deanonymizing the client.  Clients can make an exception to this behavior if the DoH server designated by the local network is known to be a non-local service, such as when a local network configures a centralized public resolver to handle its DNS operations.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.2">6.2.</a> <a href="#local-use-cases" id="local-use-cases">Local Use Cases</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">The various use cases for selecting locally-provisioned resolvers require different approaches for deployment and client resolution. The following list is not exhaustive, but provides guidance on how these scenarios can be achieved using the Adaptive DNS algorithm.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.2.1">6.2.1.</a> <a href="#accessing-local-only-resolvable-content" id="accessing-local-only-resolvable-content">Accessing Local-Only Resolvable Content</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.1.p.1">Some names are not resolvable using generic DNS resolvers, but require using a DNS server that can resolve private names. This is common in enterprise scenarios, in which an enterprise can have a set of private names that it allows to be resolved when connected to a VPN or an enterprise-managed Wi-Fi network. In this case, clients that do not use the locally-provisioned resolver will fail to resolve private names.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.1.p.2">In these scenarios, the local network SHOULD designate a local DoH server for the domains that are locally resolvable. For example, an enterprise that owns &#8220;private.example.org&#8221; would advertise &#8220;private.example.org&#8221; in its PvD information along with a DoH URI template. Clients could then use that locally-configured resolver with names under &#8220;private.example.org&#8221; according to the rules in <a href="#designating-local-servers" class="xref">Section 6.1</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.1.p.3">In general, clients SHOULD only create designated DoH server associations when they can validate a SVCB record using DNSSEC. However, some deployments of private names might not want to sign all private names within a zone. There are thus a few possible deployment models:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;private.example.org&#8221; does have a DNSSEC-signed SVCB record that points to the local DoH server.  The client requests the SVCB record for &#8220;private.example.org&#8221; using the local DoH server that is specified in the PvD information, and from that point on uses the local DoH server for names under &#8220;private.example.org&#8221;.</li>
<li>Instead of signing &#8220;private.example.org&#8221;, the deployment provides a DNSSEC-signed SVCB record for &#8220;example.org&#8221;, thus steering all resolution under &#8220;example.org&#8221; to the local resolver.</li>
<li>No DNSSEC-signed SVCB record designates the local server. In this case, clients have a hint that the local network can serve names under &#8220;private.example.org&#8221;, but do not have a way to validate the designation. Clients can in this case try to resolve names using external servers (such as via Oblivious DoH), and then MAY fall back to using locally-provisioned resolvers if the names do not resolve externally. This approach has the risk of exposing private names to public resolvers, which can be undesirable for certain enterprise deployments. Alternatively, if the client trusts the local network based on specific policy configured on the client, it can choose to resolve these names locally first. Note that this approach risks exposing names to a potentially malicious network that is masquerading as an authority for private names if the network cannot be validated in some other manner.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.1.p.5">Deployments SHOULD use the one of the first two approaches (signing their records) whenever possible; the case of providing unsigned names is only described as a possibility for handling legacy enterprise deployments. Clients SHOULD choose to ignore any locally designated names that are not signed unless there is a specific policy configuration on the client.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.1">Other names may be resolvable both publicly and on the local resolver, but have more optimized servers that are accessible only via the local network. For example, a Wi-Fi provider may provide access to a cache of video content that provides lower latency than publicly-accessible caches.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.2">Names that are hosted locally in this way SHOULD use a designation with a DNSSEC-signed SVCB record for the name. If a client discovers that a local resolver is designated for a given name, the client SHOULD prefer using connections to this locally-hosted content rather than names resolved externally.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.3">Note that having a DNSSEC-signed designation to the local resolver provides a clear indication that the entity that manages a given name has an explicit relationship with the local network provider.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.p.1">Some networks do not provide any access to the general Internet, but host local content that clients can access. For example, a network on an airplane can give access to flight information and in-flight media, but will not allow access to any external hosts or DNS servers. These networks are often described as &#8220;walled-gardens&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.p.2">Captive networks <a href="#I-D.ietf-capport-architecture" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-capport-architecture]</a> are similar in that they block access to external hosts, although they can provide generic access after some time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.p.3">If a walled-garden or captive network defines a PvD with additional information, it can define zones for names that it hosts, such as &#8220;airplane.example.com&#8221;. It can also provide a locally-hosted encrypted DNS server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.p.4">However, if such a network does not support explicitly advertising local names, clients that try to establish connections to DoH servers will experience connection failures.  In these cases, system traffic that is used for connecting to captive portals SHOULD use local resolvers. In addition, clients MAY choose to fall back to using direct resolution without any encryption if they determine that all connectivity is blocked otherwise.  Note that this comes with a risk of a network blocking connections in order to induce this fallback behavior, so clients might want to inform users about this possible attack where appropriate, or prefer to not fall back if there is a concern about leaking user data.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.6.2.4">6.2.4.</a> <a href="#network-based-filtering" id="network-based-filtering">Network-Based Filtering</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.4.p.1">Some networks currently rely on manipulating DNS name resolution in order to apply content filtering rules to clients associated with the network. Using encrypted DNS resolvers that are not participating in this filtering can bypass such enforcement. However, simply blocking connections for filtering is indistinguishable from a malicious attack from a client&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.4.p.2">In order to indicate the presence of filtering requirements, a network deployment can add the &#8220;requireDNSFiltering&#8221; and &#8220;dnsFilteredZones&#8221; keys to its PvD information.  The &#8220;dnsFilteredZones&#8221; entry can contain an array of strings, each of which is a domain name that the network requires clients to resolve using the local resolver. If the array contains the string &#8220;.&#8221;, it indicates the network requires filtering for all domains. If &#8220;requireDNSFiltering&#8221; is present with a boolean value of true, the network is indicating that it expects all client systems to send the names indicated by &#8220;dnsFilteredZones&#8221; to the local resolver. If &#8220;requireDNSFiltering&#8221; is not present or set to false, then the filtering service is considered to be optional for clients that want to use it as a service to enforce desired policy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.4.p.3">Clients that receive indication of filtering requirements SHOULD NOT use any other resolver for the filtered domains, but treat the network as claiming authority. However, since this filtering cannot be authenticated, this behavior SHOULD NOT be done silently without user consent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.4.p.4">Networks that try to interfere with connections to encrypted DNS resolvers without indicating a requirement for filtering cannot be distinguished from misconfigurations or network attacks. Clients MAY choose to avoid sending any user-initiated connections on such networks to prevent malicious interception.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#performance-considerations" id="performance-considerations">Performance Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">One of the challenges of using non-local DNS servers (such as cloud-based DoH servers) is that recursive queries made by these servers will originate from an IP address that is not necessarily geographically related to the client. Many DNS servers make assumptions about the geographic locality of clients to their recursive resolvers to optimize answers.  To avoid this problem, the client&#8217;s subnet can be forwarded to the authoritative server by the recursive using the EDNS0 Client Subnet feature. Oblivious DoH discourages this practice for privacy reasons. However, sharing this subnet, while detrimental to privacy, can result in better targeted DNS resolutions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">Adaptive DNS splits DoH queries into two sets: those made to Designated DoH Servers, and those made to Oblivious DoH servers. Oblivious queries are sensitive for privacy, and can encounter performance degradation as a result of not using the client subnet.  Queries to designated DoH servers, on the other hand, are sent directly by clients, so the client IP address is made available to these servers. Since these servers are designated by the authority for the names, they can use the IP address subnet information to tune DNS answers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">Based on these properties, clients SHOULD prefer lookups via Designated DoH Servers over oblivious mechanisms whenever possible. Servers can encourage this by setting large TTLs for SVCB records and using longer TTLs for responses returned by their Designated DoH Server endpoints which can be more confident they have accurate addressing information.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8">
<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#security-considerations" id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">In order to avoid interception and modification of the information retrieved by clients using Adaptive DNS, all exchanges between clients and servers are performed over encrypted connections, e.g., TLS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">Malicious adversaries may block client connections to all DoH or Oblivious DoH services as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) measure. Clients which cannot connect to any proxy may, by local policy, fall back to unencrypted DNS if this occurs.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9">
<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> <a href="#privacy-considerations" id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">Clients must be careful in determining to which DoH servers they send queries directly without proxying. A malicious DoH server that can direct queries to itself can track or profile client activity. In order to avoid the possibility of a spoofed SVCB record designating a malicious DoH server for a name, clients MUST ensure that such records validate using DNSSEC <a href="#RFC4033" class="xref">[RFC4033]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">Even servers that are officially designated can risk leaking or logging information about client lookups. Such risk can be mitigated by further restricting the list of DoH servers that are whitelisted for direct use based on client policy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">Using Oblivious DoH reduces the risk that a single DoH server can track or profile a client. However, clients should exercise caution when using Oblivious DoH responses from resolvers that do not carry DNSSEC signatures. An adversarial Oblivious Target resolver that wishes to learn the IP address of clients requesting resolution for sensitive domains can redirect clients to unique addresses of its choosing. Clients that use these answers when establishing TLS connections may then leak their local IP address to chosen server.  Thus, when Oblivious DoH answers are returned without DNSSEC, Privacy-Sensitive Connections concerned about this attack SHOULD conceal their IP address via a TLS- or HTTP-layer proxy or some other tunneling mechanism.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.4">An adversary able to see traffic on each path segment of a DoH or Oblivious DoH query (e.g., from client to proxy, proxy to target, and target to an authoritative DNS server) can link queries to specific clients with high probability. Failure to observe traffic on any one of these path segments makes this linkability increasingly difficult. For example, if an adversary can only observe traffic between a client and proxy and egress traffic from a target, then it may be difficult identify a specific client&#8217;s query among the recursive queries generated by the target.</p>
